##Warframe Unity
Keep your finger on the trigger and stay up to date with the Warframe universe while out of game! Keep track of in game alerts, foundry crafting and progression details along with character planning and information on warframes, modules, items, sentinels, modules and manufacturing. Provides many useful features including out of game windows notifications and email notifications if you desire to keep in touch with the Warframe universe!

##About
The main goal is to create a lightweight program similar to EVEMon which provides important information about your warframe and crafting along with important alerts and various information on modules, artifacts and items. Including helpful suggestions on where to go to get specific foundry mats or items in a simple non-cluttered design.

As feature to come later will be a simple way to plan your warframe and design your dream module combination. At the moment however this feature hasn't had much planning and is lower down on the list.

For the time being this will be a windows desktop alternative to the popular app Warframe Nexus which can be found here.
